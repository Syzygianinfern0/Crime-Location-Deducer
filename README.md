# Crime-Location-Deducer
Generates Redacted Latitudes and Longitudes of missing entries. Task 1 of my Spider Inductions for the Summer of '19
### Code Stack
* numpy - matrix manipulations
* folium - map generator
* matplotlib - pyplots visualisation
* pandas - dataset handler
* seaborn - correlations and heatmaps

# Files and Folders:
* assets - Some Images
* Final - Has the train, test, validation data which has been organised
* Weights - Trained model's Weights
* S P Sharan.ipynb - The notebook corresponding to the code.

Notes:
* The model if to be tested by anyone, I recommend to start from the "Scaling and Normalisation" 
part where the assets are loaded in and can proceed from there to satisfy all dependencies. 
* Any external dataset if to be used must follow all manipulations undergone by the train/test/validation 
data. It's pretty easy to port the code as required as everything is modular and functions exist for all tasks
